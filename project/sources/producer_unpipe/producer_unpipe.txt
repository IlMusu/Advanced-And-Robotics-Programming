The 'producer_unpipe' process:
First, it gets, as arguments, the two file descriptors which represent the unnamed pipe ends for reading and writing, and it closes the descriptor used for reading (it is not needed).
Second, it gets, as argument, the array size and creates an array of chars (if there is enough memory) using the malloc function and fills it with random data.
Before the comunication starts, the process gets the current time and comunicates it to the master process.
Then, it writes on the unnamed pipe the data that needs to be transferred to the consumer process.
Finally, it frees the memory allocated for the array.
