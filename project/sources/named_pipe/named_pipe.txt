If the user chooses the named pipe as the interprocess communication type, the two processes created by the 'master' process will
behave as follows.

'producer' process: the process opens the named pipe in write only mode; then, after getting the array length via one of the
arguments of the main function, it creates a data array (if there is enough memory) which will be filled with random characters.
After this, the process gets the time before starting the transmission and finally it writes every element of the arrayon the named pipe.
Once the transmission is finished the memory used for the array is freed and the named pipe is closed.

'consumer' process: the process opens the named pipe in read only mode; then, after getting the array length via one of the
arguments of the main function, it creates a data array (if there is enough memory) and finally the process fills the array by reading from
the pipe the data transmitted by the 'producer' process.
Once the transmission is finished the process gets the time, it frees the memory used for the array and the named pipe is closed.
