The 'consumer_socket' process: 
First, it gets, as argument, the array size.
Second, it opens a socket via the corresponding system call and receives a file descriptor representing the opened socket.
After that, the process creates a sockaddr_in struct and initializes it with some data relative to the server and also port number (which is 51234).
Then, it binds the server address to the socket creating a server.
Then, the process makes the server listen for clients: once a client request is received and accepted, the process obtains a new file descriptor that can be used to comunicate with the client. 
After that, it creates an array of chars (if there is enough memory) using the malloc function. 
Then, it reads from the socket the data transmitted by the producer process.
Once the transmission is finished, the process gets the current time and comunicates it to the master process.
Finally, it frees the memory allocated for the array.
