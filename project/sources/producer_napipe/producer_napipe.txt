The 'producer_napipe' process: 
First, it opens the named pipe in write only mode.
Second, it gets, as argument, the array size and creates an array of chars (if there is enough memory) using the malloc function and fills it with random data.
Before the comunication starts, the process gets the current time and comunicates it to the master process.
Then, it writes on the named pipe the data that needs to be transferred to the consumer process.
Then, it frees the memory allocated for the array.
Finally, it closes the named pipe used for the comunication.
