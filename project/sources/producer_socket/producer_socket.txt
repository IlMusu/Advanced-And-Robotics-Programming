The 'producer_socket' process: 
First, it gets, as argument, the array size.
Second, it opens a socket via the corresponding system call and receives a file descriptor representing the opened socket.
After that, the process creates a hostnet struct to contain the the server hostname and uses this struct to create a sockaddr_in struct and initialize it with some data relative to the server and also port number (which is 51234).
Then, the process uses the just created struct to make a connection request to the server
After that, it creates an array of chars (if there is enough memory) using the malloc function and fills it with random data.
Before the comunication starts, the process gets the current time and comunicates it to the master process.
Then, it writes to the socket the data that needs to be transmitted to the consumer process.
Finally, it frees the memory allocated for the array.
