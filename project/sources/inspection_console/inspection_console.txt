The 'inspection_console' process comunicates with 'motor_x' and 'motor_z' processes to retrieve informations about their current position. When new information is available (and correcly retrieved), it is printed on the console output.
This process is also responsible for handling part of the comunication with the user: while using this console, the user can insert the commands 's' and 'r'. Both these commands make the process send signals to the motors:
- s : stops the hoist until a new command is promted
- r : moves the hoist to the initial position
This process is considered active when it received a new command from the user, and so, if this happens it sends an activity signal to the 'watchdog' process.
