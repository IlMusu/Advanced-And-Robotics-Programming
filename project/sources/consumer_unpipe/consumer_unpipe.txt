The 'consumer_unpipe' process:
First, it gets, as arguments, the two file descriptors which represent the unnamed pipe ends for reading and writing, and it closes the descriptor used for writing (it is not needed).
Second, it gets, as argument, the array size and creates an array of chars (if there is enough memory) using the malloc function.
Then, it reads on the unnamed pipe the data transmitted by the producer process.
Once the transmission is finished, the process gets the current time and comunicates it to the master process.
Finally, it frees the memory allocated for the array.
