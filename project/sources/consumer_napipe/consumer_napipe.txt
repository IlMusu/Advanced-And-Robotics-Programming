The 'consumer_napipe' process: 
First, it opens the named pipe in read only mode.
Second, it gets, as argument, the array size and creates an array of chars (if there is enough memory) using the malloc function.
Then, it reads on the named pipe the data transmitted by the producer process.
Once the transmission is finished, the process gets the current time and comunicates it to the master process.
Then, it frees the memory allocated for the array.
Finally, it closes the named pipe used for the comunication.
