The 'command_console' process handles part of the comunication between the program and the user: while using this console, the user is continuously prompted to enter commands for the hoist.
There are 7 different valid commands:
- x_inc : makes the hoist move on positive x asis
- x_dec : makes the hoist move on negative x asis
- x_stp : makes the host stop the motion on x asis
- z_inc : makes the hoist move on positive z asis
- z_dec : makes the hoist move on negative z asis
- z_stp : makes the host stop the motion on z asis
- help  : prints commands and their functions
This process is considered active if it receives a command (let it be invalid or valid) and so, it sends an activity signal to the 'watchdog' process.
After the process receives a command:
1. If the command is 'help', then it is valid.
Otherwise, the process checks the validity of the command in three subsequent steps:
1. The first char of the string must be either 'x' or 'z'.
2. The second char of the string must be '_'.
3. The remaing part of the string must be 'inc' or 'dec' or 'stp'.
Only if the command is valid, this process comunicates the command to the motor processes, otherwise, the user is informed that the command was not valid.
