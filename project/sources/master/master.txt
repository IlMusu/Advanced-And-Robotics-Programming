The 'master' process handles the creation of the transmission channel. In particular, the process prompts the user to
choose one type of interprocess communication among the following:
1. unnamed pipe;
2. named pipe;
3. socket;
4. shared memory with circular buffer.
After this, the 'master' process prompts the user to decide the length of an array of data, from 1Mb to 100Mb, which will have to
be transmitted from a child process to its father process via the transmission channel chosen by the user; if the user chooses the 
shared memory with the circular buffer, the process will also prompt the user to choose the length of the buffer, from 1 Kb to 100Kb.
Then the 'master' process proceeds to create two processes, 'producer' and 'consumer', using the function 'fork()' and 
it calculates the communication time between these two processes.
After displaying the transferring time the 'master' process terminates.
